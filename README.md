# python-framework
A collection of python libraries 

## NOTE ##
Currently, the framework is built for python 3.8 and there might be compatibility issues with newer python versions.

## psycopg ##
One of the dependencies is psycopg2, which requires an installed `pg_config` binary.
If you install postgresql on your system via your OS package manager, `pg_config` will be included.
